Blockchain Bootcamp

Blockchain Layer 1
Blockchain Layer 2

Type of Layer 2s
    Rollups 
    optimistic Rollups
    zero knowledge Rollups (zkSync) => use zkSync cryptography 

layer two monitering webstie

IPFS => InterPlantary File system for web3 world
    pinata => upload files and images  on the internete
    fleek.co - Build on the internet for hosting 

 Cryptography 
    - Hiding information
    - Encoding 
    - Decoding

Encryption Algorithem
    Raw data
    Digist
    Cipher
Hashing Functions
    -Fixed Range (constant length digist )
    -Deterministic (no varation for the same input)
    -Discontinous (chenge in the input complatly change the digist)
    -No invertible (no back )
For Blockchain use Cryptography
    Accounts => Key pair, private key, public key, Address
    Blocks
    Consensus
Hashing Algorithems
    - ECDSA (Ellictic Curve Digital Signature Algorithem)
    - Kaccak-256 last 20 Bytes , add 0x


Ganache 
    VISUAL MNEMONIC & ACCOUNT INFO
    Quickly see the current status of all accounts, including their addresses, private keys, transactions and balances.

They are not the same
     Wallet => A software that manage accounts
    Address => 0xhh 
    Account
    Public key

If we have a private key we can generate the public key by Hashing Algorithems 
    - Private key is for one Account but seed phrases is the master password to lock multiple accounts


Smart Contracts
Web 2
    USER ------> BROWSER---->FRTONTEND ---->BACLEND(Server and Database)(By Python, js or )
Web 3
    USER ------> BROWSER---->FRTONTEND ---->Blockchain(Users, data Programs)By solidity Programming languge 

Smart Contracts
    Digital representation of real world contracts
    CODE IS LAW


PROPERTIES OF smart contract
        Agreement
        immutable
        transparent
        vending Machine
Enabls complex transactions

Realworld Examples based by smart contract
    Token
    NFT
    Decentralized Exchange

ERC-20 Token ---> Standard For Cryptocurrency on Ethereum network
ERC-721 Token ---> Standard for NFT on Ethereum network


NFT (Non -Fungible Tokens)
Fungible
    Not unique
    Worth the same 
    No Hierarchy
    e.g Bitcoin, Birr
Non Fungible
    unique
    Worth differnt amounts
    Hierarchy
    unique in
    e.g Trading Card, Realstate, concet Ticket

USe case of NFT
    Digital identity
    Real Estate
    Intellectual Properties 
    Tickets
